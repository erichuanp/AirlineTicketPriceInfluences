    "In a globalizing world, air travel has become increasingly important not only for economic purposes, but for individual purposes as well. However, since the early 2000s, fuel prices have continued to increase, making it ever more important to optimize fuel efficiency. Consumers are increasingly concerned about their carbon footprint when they fly, and some airlines are offering dubious, albeit optional, carbon offset add-ons to their tickets.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Not only do CO2 emissions from commercial flights contribute to air pollution, but ticket costs are also affected by fuel prices and consumption rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to an article by the firm McKinsey & Company, between 2005 and 2019 airlines managed to decrease fuel per passenger-kilometer by 39%.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Roughly half of this decrease owes itself to an increase in seat density and percentage of seats per flight sold. Airlines increased the number of passengers per plane by 82% in 2005 and by 88% in 2019.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Next, fleet upgrades account for a little less than half of this decrease in fuel per passenger-kilometer.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) As aircrafts have become more aerodynamic, they’ve become more fuel efficient as well. Other factors like route optimization accounts for less than 7% of the improved fuel mileage. As technological advancements slow down, airlines inevitably have begun to hit a plateau in improving fuel efficiency. Likewise, increasing aircraft density can only go so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the paper *Fuel consumption optimization in air transport* by Singh and Sharma examines historical trends of fuel consumption optimization (FCO). They identify four factors that affect fuel consumption: aircraft technology & design, aviation operations & infrastructure, socioeconomic & policy measures, and alternate fuels & fuel properties.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) The authors found that “Fuel consumption is one of major direct operating cost parameters in the air transport industry” and accounts for roughly 28% of operating costs, but in the future it may account for as much as 45%.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Similar to the findings of McKinsey, while jet fuel has increased significantly since 2005, fuel efficiency improvements have slowed down since the 1980s. Airline route optimization is incredibly complex, bringing together diverse factors such as aircraft performance, weather, route and regulatory restrictions, luggage and passenger capacity, and global fuel and travel economics.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) For the scope of our project, we will be focusing mainly on the relationship between cabin density and fuel consumption per passenger-kilometer. We hope to understand how external factors such as weather also play into fuel consumption and subsequently ticket prices. We hope to study precipitation levels in origin and destination airports, fuel consumption, and ticket prices of those flights. Our goal is to determine whether future aircraft manufacturing efforts should aim to make airplanes more adaptable to poor weather conditions by determining if weather is a factor affecting fuel consumption.\n",

    "Experience suggests that very increased precipitation leads to more frequent encounters with unstable air currents for aircraft, necessitating changes in flight altitude and routes, but small amounts of precipitation probably have little impact on flight routes. This likely results in underestimations of optimal fuel consumption and higher actual fuel usage in extreme weather. To offset the additional operational costs, airlines are expected to raise ticket prices when weather is less predictable (such as in the winter) and fuel consumption is high."

    "\n",
    "    The ideal datasets to answer this question would cover daily precipitation levels in origin & destination cities (i.e. Los Angeles and New York City), flight fuel consumption per mile, and average ticket price for that flight. This would be organized in a table, where each entry corresponds to a specific flight between two given cities. One column would have the airline, another would have the average price a passenger on that plane paid for their seat, another would have the fuel consumption per mile which that flight used, and the last two would have the precipitation levels at the origin and destination cities, respectively. We are interested in trends in recent years, so the data only needs to cover the last 5 or so years. While an ideal analysis would look at all flights between the given cities, we may need to restrict our study to the offerings of a few airlines. This means that the number of observations would be close to the number of flights between the given cities in the last 5 years, operated by the top few airlines (United, American Airlines, Delta).\n",

    "- https://www.transtats.bts.gov/AverageFare/ This dataset, also from the U.S. Department of Transportation, is a table of Average Domestic Airline Itinerary Fares By Origin City.

    "- It was very difficult to find a comprehensive dataset for specific flights over time, especially at a daily granularity. The closest we could find was this month-by-month comparison graph: https://www.faredetective.com/farehistory/flights-from-Los_Angeles-LAX-to-New_York-NYC.html. This would enable us to compare prices over a time scale of a year, but not based on daily weather events or individual flight fuel consumption.\n",
